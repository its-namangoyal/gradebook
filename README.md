Under this project, named “Gradebook”, having extended name “Grading digital book for the exam”, I have created a webpage showcasing the details of marks of students and other statistics regarding the same for easy depiction. The data has been primarily fetched from the json file. And has been structured in tabular form having the following fields: id, name, ticket number, exam grade, rating grade, final grade, status, details (wherein details such as ticket number, ticket course, exam grade, rating grade, final grade, status, comment for that selected student will pop out. Further the statistics show the details such as all students, average of all grades, maximum of all grades, minimum of all grades, final grades 0-4, final grades 4-5, final grades 5-6, final grades 6-7, final grades 7-8, final grade above 8. Moreover, it depicts 3 bar charts each showing result, average grades, minimum and maximum respectively and 1 pie chart showing the final grades.
